# 🚢 Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship (Task 2)


## 📖 Overview
This repository contains my work for **Task 2** of the *Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship*.  
For this task, I analyzed the famous **Titanic dataset**, performing **data cleaning** 🧹 and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** 📊 to identify survival patterns and relationships.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details
The dataset used in this task can be found here: [Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/d2kshh/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/Titanic_Dataset.csv).  
It includes passenger information such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, class)
- Ticket and fare details
- Survival status

This dataset is a popular choice for practicing beginner-to-intermediate data science skills.

---

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning** – Filled missing values, handled null entries, and dropped columns with excessive missing data.  
2. **EDA** – Visualized relationships between variables such as:
   - Gender & Survival
   - Passenger Class & Survival
   - Age Distribution
   - Fare Distribution
3. **Pattern Identification** – Discovered trends showing higher survival for females, younger passengers, and those in higher classes.

---

## 📌 Key Observations
- **Gender Impact**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **Class Influence**: 1st-class passengers survived more often than 3rd-class passengers.
- **Age Factor**: Younger passengers had slightly better survival odds.
- **Fare Relationship**: Higher fares correlated with better survival chances.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This task highlights how data preprocessing and visualization techniques can uncover meaningful insights from raw datasets.  
Analyzing the Titanic dataset not only provides historical context but also strengthens core **data science** skills.
